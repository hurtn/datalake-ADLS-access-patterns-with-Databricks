</p>

3. Click on <b>test_container</b> and then you should be able to see the folders inside the container. Then, click <b>...</b> icon on the rightern side of the <b>iot_devices</b> folder and select <b>Manage ACLs</b>:
<p align="center">
  <img width="850" src="media/pattern_3_step_3.png" />
</p>

4. When the ACLs for the <b>iot_devices</b> folder are displayed, add the principals for the active directory group <b>group1</b> and check <b>Read</b> and <b>Execute</b> and click to <b>Save</b> button:
<p align="center">
  <img width="850" src="media/pattern_3_step_4.png" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img width="850" src="media/pattern_3_step_5.png" />
</p>

6. Navigate to the <b>premium Azure Databricks Workspace > Overview</b> and click <b>Launch Workspace</b> button, choose and <b>an admin</b> user to login. When Azure Databricks Workspace is displayed, navigate to <b>Compute</b>. Then, create a Standard cluster for <b>TestUser1</b> enabling the credential passthrough with the following settings. Set the permissions to allow <b>IoTDevicesGroup</b> to attach this cluster: 
<p align="center">
  <img width="850" src="media/pattern_3_step_6.png" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img width="450" src="media/pattern_3_step_6_a.png" />
</p>

7. Then, create another Standard cluster for <b>TestUser2</b> enabling the credential passthrough with the following settings.Set the permissions to allow <b>LoanGroup</b> to attach this cluster: 
<p align="center">
  <img width="850" src="media/pattern_3_step_7.png" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img width="450" src="media/pattern_3_step_7_a.png" />
</p>

8. Navigate to the premium Azure Databricks <b>Workspace > Overview</b> on Azure Portal and click <b>Launch Workspace</b> button, choose and <b>TestUser1</b> user to login. When Azure Databricks Workspace is displayed, navigate to <b>Workspace</b>, then upload [pattern3-AADPassthrough-group1.ipynb](notebooks\testuser1\pattern3-AADPassthrough-group1.ipynb) notebook to the Databricks Workspace and open the notebook, attach & start the cluster created in step 6 and then run all cells: 
<p align="center">
  <img width="850" src="media/pattern_3_step_8.png" />
</p>

<i>RESULT: Files unders /iot_devices folder are readable meanwhile /loans raise an exception due to lack of privileges to access these files on ADLS Gen2. These permissions are limited thanks to the privileges of group1 on ADLS Gen2 ACLs.</i> 

9. Navigate to the premium Azure Databricks <b>Workspace > Overview</b>on Azure Portal and click <b>Launch Workspace</b> button, choose and <b>TestUser2</b> user to login. When Azure Databricks Workspace is displayed, navigate to <b>Workspace</b>, then upload [pattern3-AADPassthrough-group2.ipynb](notebooks\testuser2\pattern3-AADPassthrough-group2.ipynb) notebook to the Databricks Workspace and open the notebook, attach & start the cluster created in step 7 and then run all cells:
